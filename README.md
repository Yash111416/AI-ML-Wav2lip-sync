# AI/ML-Wav2lip-sync-Assessment 1
This project focuses on lip-syncing, using the Wav2Lip repository as a reference. Wav2Lip is a lip-syncing algorithm that generates realistic lip movements for a given speech input.

## Wav2Lip Repository
The core lip-syncing functionality of this project is built upon the Wav2Lip repository by Rudrabha Mukhopadhyay. Wav2Lip provides an implementation of the lip-syncing algorithm based on deep learning techniques.

Please refer to the Wav2Lip repository for detailed documentation, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Project Overview
The lip-syncing project extends the capabilities of Wav2Lip by incorporating additional features, enhancements, and customizations specific to our requirements. The project aims to provide an improved lip-syncing experience and explore further applications of the technology.

## Features
Advanced speech-to-lip synchronization
Real-time lip movement generation
Integration with video and audio processing libraries
Customization options for lip shape and animation
Support for different languages and speech accents
